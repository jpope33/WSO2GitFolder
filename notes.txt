GENERAL ARCHITECTURE
	SSO: Allows users to log in to ViFi using any number of external accout credentials such as Google, Salesforce, Linken, etc
	Federated:  








WSO2 NATIVE TOOLS
KEY GENERATION:
First K is wrongfully capitalized, replace with k
keytool -export -alias wso2carbon -file wso2.crt -keystore wso2carbon.jks -storepass wso2carbon


JAVA
Invalid key length or security configuration
	Due to the default limited security policy being used as opposed to unlimited.
	Java 1.8_151 and > come with both limited and unlimited preinstalled but require edit to /<IS_HOME>


SALESFORCE
Signature Hash Type in Salesforce SSO settings

FRESHDESK
Can't setup password policies while SSO enabled
	 This is by design, no issue


POSSIBLE FUTURE ISSUES:
Warning
The JKS keystore uses a proprietary format. It is recommended to migrate to PKCS12 which is an industry standard format using "keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore wso2carbon.jks -destkeystore wso2carbon.jks -deststoretype pkcs12".
