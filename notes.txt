GENERAL ARCHITECTURE
	SSO: Allows users to log in to ViFi using any number of external accout credentials such as Google, Salesforce, Linken, etc
	Federated:  








WSO2 NATIVE TOOLS
KEY GENERATION:
First K is wrongfully capitalized, replace with k
keytool -export -alias wso2carbon -file wso2.crt -keystore wso2carbon.jks -storepass wso2carbon


JAVA
Invalid key length or security configuration
	Due to the default limited security policy being used as opposed to unlimited.
	Java 1.8_151 and > come with both limited and unlimited preinstalled but require edit to /<IS_HOME>


SALESFORCE
Signature Hash Type in Salesforce SSO settings
https://jbpdevaddress-dev-ed.my.salesforce.com?so=00D1I000001gsiO


FRESHDESK
Can't setup password policies while SSO enabled
	 This is by design, no issue


POSSIBLE FUTURE ISSUES:
Warning
The JKS keystore uses a proprietary format. It is recommended to migrate to PKCS12 which is an industry standard format using "keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore wso2carbon.jks -destkeystore wso2carbon.jks -deststoretype pkcs12".





			SSO Configuration

/usr/local/bin/wso2-5.3.0/repository/resources/security/wso2.crt
ws02.crt
	Contains md5, sha1 and sha256
	Signed with 'SHA1withRSA' 1024 bit key
	Alias: wso2carbon


Salesforce Account Info
	username 			jbpdevaddress@uncc.com
	custom domain		jbpdevaddress-dev-ed.my.salesforce.com
	email				jbpdevaddress@gmail.com

Salesforce Account Settings
	IdP Login url: 		https://localhost:9443/samlsso
	IdP Cert:			Looks like it's wso2.crt...
	Request Sig Cert:	SelfSignedCert (Confused again, this cert is 2048 bit)
	Request Sig Method:	RSA-SHA1
	Assertion isn't being encrypted right now

WSO2 Account Settings
	Claim Config : email
	SAML2 Web SSO Config:
		Issuer:		https://saml.salesforce.com
		Assertion: 	https://jbpdevaddress-dev-ed.my.salesforce.com?so=00D1I000001gsiO
		Alias: 		wso2carbon.crt (this seems wrong??): The alias for the wso2.crt is wso2carbon, there is no wso2carbon.crt??
		Response Sign:	rsa-sha1
		Response Digest: sha1
		Assertion isn't being encrypted


Observations
Logs out at Salesforce
					





Freshdesk Account Info
	username
	custom domain		uncc.freshdesk.com
	email				jbpdevaddress@gmail.com

Freshdesk Account Settings
	IdP Login url:		https://localhost:9443/samlsso
	SHA1 Fingerprint from wso2.cert used a credential, this is used because cert is signed with SHA1

WSO2 Account Settings
	Claim Config : email
	SAML2 Web SSO Config:
		Issuer: 	uncc.freshdesk.com
		Assertion: 	https://uncc.freshdesk.com/login/saml
		Alias: 		wso2carbon.crt (this seems wrong??): The alias for the wso2.crt is wso2carbon, there is no wso2carbon.crt??
					Salesforce still works also even though the assertion is being encrypted?
		Response Sign:	rsa-sha256 (This shouldn't be correct either I don't think? The cert signature is hashed with sha1?)
						Still works because reponse isn't being signed??
		Response Digest: sha256


Observations
Logs out at WSO2
Email address in WSO2 maps to 'Full Name' attribute in Freshdesk and is required in WSO2.
User only needs BasicUser permissions for SSO, I believe b/c BU has Login permissions.
